📊 Walmart Sales Forecasting & Analysis

---

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting weekly sales for Walmart stores using historical sales data.
The goal is to understand sales patterns, variability, seasonality, and to build a predictive regression-based model that can estimate future sales.

The notebook combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical insights, and machine learning regression to derive meaningful business conclusions.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical weekly sales data for Walmart stores along with additional influencing factors such as:

Store information

Holiday indicators

Economic variables (fuel price, CPI, unemployment)

Time-based features (week, month, year)

Target Variable:

Weekly_Sales (continuous)

📌 Key Learnings

Real-world sales data shows non-trivial variance

Holidays and temporal features significantly impact demand

Regression models and Ensemble Learning is powerful for explainable forecasting

Proper EDA is critical before model building

---

📎 Future Improvements

Incorporate time-series models (ARIMA / SARIMAX)

Use tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest)

Add store-level clustering

Improve forecasts using holiday-specific modeling
